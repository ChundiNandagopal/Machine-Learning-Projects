# Breast Cancer Detection: Malignant or Benign 🩺✨
📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based classification model to predict whether a patient has malignant or benign breast cancer. The model leverages historical data and various diagnostic parameters, such as the radius, texture, smoothness, and others, to deliver accurate and reliable predictions.

📊 Dataset
Source: The dataset is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, commonly used in medical research.
Features: Includes multiple attributes such as mean radius, perimeter, area, smoothness, and texture.
Target:
0: Benign (non-cancerous)
1: Malignant (cancerous)

🚀 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries & Frameworks:
NumPy
Pandas
